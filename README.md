# comp-7082-assign-g1

I tried to clone the master repo in Android Studio and could not get a working environment. Therefore, I started a new project and compared both, adding in the changes from the demo project. If you check out the link below, you can see that the structure of this branch resembles that of their sample projects, hence why I'm proposing this branch to be the starting point.
